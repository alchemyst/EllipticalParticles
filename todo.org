To do:

* TODO Check definition of beta
* TODO Should SigmaBar1 be an input or should it just always be 1?  Since we don't control the magnitude of loading but only the shape?
  
* TODO Test principal.m and unprincipal.m functions - especially calculation
of alpha in principal.m

* TODO Can't cope with zero stress in 11 direction at the moment.

* TODO Write steploads quantities to loads quantities at end of timestep. 
Also, use loads quantities from previous timestep as first guess for steploads quantities?

* TODO Check eq 4.80 - have we accounted for plane stress/plane strain?

* TODO Run checks on macrostress subroutine - many many typos may introduce errors.

* TODO Check that A_1 and A_2 are calculated correctly

* TODO Calculate phiprime2 and psiprime only when necessary - two phi functions? 
Do I ever actually need to calculate the stress?

* DONE 3/7/12: Correct calculation of cohesive law - I think this needs to be rationalised and reworked.  
** Is there any reason to have separate subroutines?  
** DONE Why are we not keeping track of the previous value of lambda?  No attempt to handle unloading. 
        --- derivation 4/7/2012,
        --- implemented 4/7/2012, still need to watch for updating
        global values


* TODO 4/7/12: Need very strict rules about updating - can't update anything inside
residual.m, I think - ask Carl?  Develop good rules for all variables
which must be updated, when it happens, how it happens.  These
changing variables I should have maps for when they are accessed and
changed. e.g. steploads quantities, disp quantities.

* DONE 5/7/12: put input file name as parameter in read_input.m
done immediately by Carl

* DONE get code into Github
  CLOCK: [2012-07-05 Thu 10:49]--[2012-07-05 Thu 12:12] =>  1:23

* DONE subroutine to copy current timestep versions of load

* TODO subroutine to copy final timestep version back into load

* TODO common features of residual.m and final.m in a new subroutine

* TODO Timestep shouldn't be needed in stack or unstack Carl has ideas 
load should be an array of structures rather than a structure containing arrays


* TODO Code Revisions
** TODO Changing Variables to minimise ambiguity and to Structure variables to allow structures to be passed rather than variables. -- Week 27 (July 2-6) and Week 29 (July 16-20)
** TODO Rationalise subroutines -- Week 30 (July 23-27)

* TODO Satisfy standard tests
** TODO Write tests -- Weeks 31 and 32 (July 30-August 10)
** TODO Debugging -- Weeks 33-34 (August 13-August 24)
** TODO Run Results and compare with previous findings for validity -- Week 35 (August 27-31)

* TODO Implement Optimisation Algorithms for Non-linear solver problem
** TODO Optimisation Technique that doesn't rely on gradients -- Weeks 36-38 (September 3-21)
** TODO Validate against Jay's code -- Weeks 39-40 (September 24-October 5)

* TODO Get Results against test cases -- Weeks 41 (October 8-12)

* TODO Write results into Dissertation (including conclusions) -- Weeks 42-43 (October 15-26)

* TODO Distribute to the committee for approval -- Weeks 44-45 (October 29-November9) 

* TODO Submit (Due November 16)
