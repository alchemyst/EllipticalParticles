To do:

* TODO Check definition of beta
* TODO Should SigmaBar1 be an input or should it just always be 1?  Since we don't control the magnitude of loading but only the shape?

* TODO Test principal.m and unprincipal.m functions - especially calculation
of alpha in principal.m

* TODO Can't cope with zero stress in 11 direction at the moment.

* TODO Write steploads quantities to loads quantities at end of timestep. 
Also, use loads quantities from previous timestep as first guess for steploads quantities?

* TODO Check eq 4.80 - have we accounted for plane stress/plane strain?

* TODO Run checks on macrostress subroutine - many many typos may introduce errors.

* TODO Check that A_1 and A_2 are calculated correctly

* TODO Calculate phiprime2 and psiprime only when necessary - two phi functions? 
Do I ever actually need to calculate the stress?

* DONE 3/7/12: Correct calculation of cohesive law - I think this needs to be rationalised and reworked.  
** Is there any reason to have separate subroutines?  
** DONE Why are we not keeping track of the previous value of lambda?  No attempt to handle unloading. 
        --- derivation 4/7/2012,
        --- implemented 4/7/2012, still need to watch for updating
        global values


* TODO 4/7/12: Need very strict rules about updating - can't update anything inside
residual.m, I think - ask Carl?  Develop good rules for all variables
which must be updated, when it happens, how it happens.  These
changing variables I should have maps for when they are accessed and
changed. e.g. steploads quantities, disp quantities.

* DONE 5/7/12: put input file name as parameter in read_input.m
done immediately by Carl

* TODO get code into Github
